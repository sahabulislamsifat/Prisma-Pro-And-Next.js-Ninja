### About the Project

**Prisma Pro & Next.js Ninja** is a full-stack learning and development repository focused on modern web application architecture using:

- **Next.js 14 (App Router)**
- **Prisma ORM**
- **PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQLite**
- **TypeScript-first development**

This project teaches you how to:

- Model databases with Prisma
- Build scalable APIs using Next.js Route Handlers
- Write clean, type-safe backend code
- Implement authentication, authorization, and data security
- Deploy full-stack apps with best practices

It’s designed for developers who want to become real **full-stack ninjas** with mastery over both the **frontend and backend**.

---

### Objectives

- Learn **Prisma ORM fundamentals** — schema, models, relations, migrations
- Understand **type-safe database queries** with Prisma Client
- Build **Next.js full-stack apps** with server components & route handlers
- Master **API design**, validation, and error handling
- Explore **real-world project structures**
- Learn to integrate **authentication** (NextAuth / JWT)
- Deploy databases & apps to cloud platforms
- Practice with full-stack mini projects

### Learning Approach

This repository follows a **build-by-learning** method:

1. Understand the concept (in `/docs`)
2. Study the schema and model design (in `/prisma`)
3. Build APIs and components (in `/src`)
4. Test, debug, and optimize queries
5. Implement real-world features
6. Deploy and scale your app

Each feature is broken into understandable pieces — making the learning curve smooth and powerful.

---

### Goal

Become a **Next.js Ninja + Prisma Pro** — someone who can:

- Design databases elegantly
- Build full-stack apps with confidence
- Write clean, type-safe, production-ready code
- Optimize queries and API performance
- Deploy scalable applications

If you can build apps faster than bugs can find you — you’ve achieved _Ninja Mode_. 🥷🔥
